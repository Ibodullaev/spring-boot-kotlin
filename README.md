# Spring Boot with Kotlin and wrapping with Integration Test
## Project is to understand the kotlin as Back-end language with Spring Boot. There are three endpoints to play with:
- GET "/book" to get all books.
- POST "/book" which takes title and isbn as json body.
- GET "/book/{title}" to find the book by title.

## Integration test also included
- to check the endpoint whether it will return 200 "OK" status code or not.
